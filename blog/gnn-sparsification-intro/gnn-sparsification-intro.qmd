  We study sparsification for Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) from three complementary viewpoints: (i) **spectral** sparsification that preserves Laplacian quadratic forms; (ii) **topological** sparsification that preserves structural invariants such as connectivity, local neighborhoods, and motif counts; and (iii) **learning-based** sparsification that selects edges (or nodes) with task-aware scores derived from attention or bilevel optimization. Our hybrid perspective clarifies when and how these families align or conflict, and it motivates evaluation beyond accuracy—considering latency, memory, and stability. We outline the research directions of the *Tremplin Recherche* project on GNN sparsification, including experimental protocols and metrics for efficient and reliable deployment.

# Introduction {#sec-intro}

Modern Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) operate on graphs $G=(V,E,w)$ with $|V|=n$ nodes and $|E|=m$ weighted edges. Despite their expressive power, the computational and memory costs of message passing typically scale with $m$, creating bottlenecks for large graphs and dense neighborhoods. **Sparsification** seeks to reduce this cost by removing (or reweighting) edges and/or nodes while maintaining task-relevant properties. Beyond efficiency, sparsification can also improve **robustness** (by attenuating noisy edges) and **generalization** (by acting as a structural regularizer).

This note proposes a **hybrid perspective** spanning three families:
- **Spectral**: preserve quadratic forms of the graph Laplacian $L$, i.e., $\forall x,\ (1-\varepsilon)\, x^\top L x \le x^\top \tilde L x \le (1+\varepsilon)\, x^\top L x$.
- **Topological**: preserve qualitative structure (e.g., connectivity, degree profile, ego-nets, motif counts).
- **Learning-based**: learn a sparsity pattern from data (e.g., via attention, gates, or bilevel selection) targeting end-task performance.

We articulate how each family connects to GNN message passing and propose a principled **evaluation protocol** covering *latency, memory, accuracy,* and *stability*. This provides a unified basis for experimental study in the **Tremplin Recherche** project.

# Background on Graph Neural Networks {#sec-background}

## Graph representation and Laplacian

Let $A$ be the weighted adjacency, $D$ the degree matrix, and $L=D-A$ the (combinatorial) Laplacian. For normalized propagation one also uses $\mathcal{L}=I-D^{-1/2} A D^{-1/2}$. The **Rayleigh quotient** $\mathcal{R}_L(x) = \frac{x^\top L x}{x^\top x}$ governs many spectral properties (e.g., cuts, diffusion).

In standard message passing, a GNN layer aggregates neighbor features:
$$
H^{(\ell+1)} = \sigma\!\big(\underbrace{\mathrm{AGG}(A, H^{(\ell)})}_{\text{propagation}} W^{(\ell)}\big),
$$
where $\mathrm{AGG}$ encodes a linear diffusion (GCN), an attention-weighted combination (GAT), or other kernels.

## Message passing as (approximate) diffusion

For GCN-like layers, propagation corresponds to multiplying by a normalized operator $S$ (e.g., $\hat{A}$ or $I-\mathcal{L}$). Multi-layer stacks approximate polynomials $p(S)$, linking representation power to the spectrum of $S$. **Sparsification** affects both the spectrum and the local neighborhoods over which messages are exchanged.

# Sparsification: Definitions and Theoretical Motivation {#sec-theory}

We consider three families and their formal desiderata.

## Spectral sparsification

A graph $\tilde G$ with Laplacian $\tilde L$ is an $\varepsilon$-**spectral sparsifier** of $G$ if
$$
(1-\varepsilon)\, x^\top L x \ \le\ x^\top \tilde L x \ \le\ (1+\varepsilon)\, x^\top L x,\quad \forall x\in\mathbb{R}^n.
$$
This implies preservation of effective resistances and many cut/flow quantities up to $1\pm\varepsilon$. For propagation operators $S$ derived from $L$, near-isospectrality yields controlled distortion of diffusion and thus controlled bias in message passing responses.

**Implication for GNNs.** When layers implement $S$-based smoothing, maintaining spectral bounds helps preserve frequency responses, attenuating oversmoothing or instabilities caused by large spectral perturbations.

## Topological sparsification

Topological criteria ensure that $\tilde G$ preserves structure such as connectivity, local degrees, hop neighborhoods, and selected subgraph counts (triangles, motifs). Typical constraints include
$$
\delta_{\text{deg}} = \max_{v\in V} \frac{|d_G(v) - d_{\tilde G}(v)|}{\max(1,d_G(v))} \le \tau,
\qquad
\text{and}\quad \mathrm{Conn}(\tilde G)=\mathrm{Conn}(G).
$$
**Implication for GNNs.** Message quality depends on neighborhood integrity. Preserving ego-nets and motif frequencies stabilizes attention weights and local mixing patterns used by expressive GNN variants.

## Learning-based sparsification

Given labeled data $(G, X, Y)$, define a sparsity mask $M\in\{0,1\}^{n\times n}$ (or relaxed $M\in[0,1]$) applied to edges, with learnable parameters $\theta$. Optimize
$$
\min_{\theta}\ \mathcal{L}_{\text{task}}\!\big(f_\theta(G\odot M, X), Y\big) + \lambda \|M\|_0 \quad
\text{s.t. (optionally) } M\in\mathcal{C},
$$
where $\mathcal{C}$ encodes constraints (budget, connectivity, degree caps, etc.). This yields task-aware sparsity patterns, often via attention scores, Gumbel-Softmax, or bilevel schemes.

**Implication for GNNs.** End-to-end selection can outperform purely structural criteria when labels are informative, but risks overfitting and distribution shift; constraints and validation protocols become crucial.

# A Hybrid Perspective and Its Tensions {#sec-hybrid}

While spectral, topological, and learning-based approaches overlap, they are **not equivalent**:

- Spectral guarantees control *global* diffusion error but may alter local motifs;
- Topological preservation maintains neighborhoods yet can drift spectrally;
- Learning-based selection optimizes task metrics but may violate either spectral or topological constraints, hurting robustness.

We therefore propose **hybrid sparsification** combining:
1. **Spectral guardrails**: enforce bounds on $\|L-\tilde L\|$ or on effective resistances;
2. **Topological fidelity**: constrain degree deviation, connectivity, or motif counts within tolerances;
3. **Task-aware refinement**: learn residual scores subject to (1)–(2).

This induces a constrained optimization view:
$$
\min_{M,\ \tilde w}\ \mathcal{L}_{\text{task}}\big(f(G_M^{\tilde w}, X), Y\big)
\quad\text{s.t.}\quad
\begin{cases}
(1-\varepsilon)\, x^\top L x \le x^\top \tilde L x \le (1+\varepsilon)\, x^\top L x, & \forall x,\\
\mathrm{Conn}(G_M)=\mathrm{Conn}(G),\ \delta_{\text{deg}}\le \tau,\ \text{motif\_err}\le \eta,\\
\|M\|_0 \leq B.
\end{cases}
$$
Here $G_M^{\tilde w}$ denotes the masked and reweighted graph, $B$ the edge budget.

# Why Sparsification Matters (Efficiency, Robustness, Generalization) {#sec-motivation}

We motivate a **balanced** view spanning efficiency, robustness, and generalization.

## Efficiency (scalability)

Compute and memory scale roughly with the number of edges used per layer. If $\tilde m \ll m$ then forward/backward costs and activation memory drop proportionally, enabling larger batches or deeper models. On-device inference also benefits from reduced latency.

## Robustness (stability to noise)

Edge noise (spurious similarities, measurement artifacts) can amplify through message passing. Spectral guardrails bound diffusion error; topological constraints stabilize neighborhood formation; learning-based priors can downweight unreliable edges.

## Generalization (regularization)

Sparsity reduces hypothesis complexity: fewer edge-mediated interactions can act as structural regularization, mitigating oversmoothing and overfitting—provided constraints avoid under-connection.

# Research Objective (Tremplin Recherche) {#sec-objective}

**Goal.** Develop and evaluate **hybrid sparsification** for GNNs that achieves **(i)** near-spectral fidelity, **(ii)** topology preservation within tolerances, and **(iii)** competitive or improved task performance under a fixed sparsity budget.

**Hypothesis.** Constrained, task-aware sparsification outperforms purely spectral or purely learned selection on *efficiency–robustness–accuracy* trade-offs, particularly under distribution shift and limited labels.

# Planned Experiments and Metrics {#sec-experiments}

## Datasets and tasks
- Node/edge classification and graph classification benchmarks (e.g., citation-style graphs, molecules, or social nets) depending on availability and licensing in your environment.
- For each dataset: construct baseline dense GNNs (e.g., GCN/GraphSAGE/GAT).

## Sparsification methods
1. **Spectral** baselines: sampling by effective resistance / leverage-like scores; reweighting via Laplacian scaling.
2. **Topological** baselines: degree-capped pruning; kNN-backbones; motif-preserving heuristics.
3. **Learning-based**: attention-thresholding; differentiable edge gates; bilevel selection with connectivity constraints.
4. **Hybrid (proposed)**: constrained learning with spectral guardrails and topology tolerances.

## Metrics
- **Accuracy/ROC** (primary task metrics).
- **Latency** (ms) and **throughput** (samples/s) at inference.
- **Memory** (peak activation + parameters).
- **Spectral distortion**: max/min ratio of Rayleigh quotients on probe vectors; eigenspectrum shift.
- **Topological distortion**: degree deviation $\delta_{\text{deg}}$, connectivity, motif error.
- **Stability**: variation under stochastic edge noise or feature noise.

## Protocol
- Fix a **sparsity budget** $B$ (or density $\rho=\tilde m/m$).
- Sweep $\varepsilon,\tau,\eta$ (spectral/topology tolerances) and report Pareto curves (latency vs. accuracy, stability vs. accuracy).
- Report ablations: spectral-only, topology-only, learning-only, and **hybrid**.

# Roadmap {#sec-roadmap}

1. **Phase I — Foundations.** Implement spectral and topology baselines; build metric suite (spectral/topological distortion, latency, memory).
2. **Phase II — Learning-based selection.** Train attention/gating with edge budgets and connectivity constraints.
3. **Phase III — Hybrid constraints.** Add spectral guardrails via penalties or projections; tune tolerances.
4. **Phase IV — Robustness.** Evaluate under noise/perturbations; study transfer across datasets.
5. **Phase V — Write-up & release.** Consolidate results, reproducible code, and benchmarks.

# Conclusion {#sec-conclusion}

Sparsification for GNNs is not a single objective but a **triad** of desiderata—efficiency, robustness, and generalization. A **hybrid** approach can reconcile spectral fidelity, topological integrity, and task-aware selection. This note frames the problem, proposes metrics and protocols, and sets the stage for the *Tremplin Recherche* experimental program.
